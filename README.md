# MedTourEasy-Blood-Donation-Prediction
Project Overview:-
This project focuses on predicting blood donations using machine learning techniques, primarily Logistic Regression. The goal is to analyze donor behavior patterns and improve donation predictions. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn. The AUC score is the primary metric for assessing model accuracy, and different models are ranked using operator.itemgetter. The development environment utilizes Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis, ensuring efficient experimentation and model tuning.

Skills & Development Tools:-
Programming Languages: Python, R
Libraries & Frameworks: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning Techniques: Classification models, Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics: AUC score, model ranking
Domain Expertise: Data analysis, healthcare analytics


Contributions:-
Enhancements to the model, feature selection improvements, and hyperparameter tuning are encouraged to boost accuracy and efficiency.
